I wrote this program using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL for my final A-Level project (my mark for the project was 72/75).
This program was designed to be used in the setting of a school where teachers could deliver quizzes to their students,
students could solve them on the platform itself, and the teacher could then analyze the progress of individual students
using graphs and raw data.
Since this is a rather large project and I had a time constraint on me, I didn't have enough time to debug the project.
While the main parts of the project work fine, I believe there may be a few sections with small bugs.
Important Note: Since you would not have the database connected on your local machine, there is a good chance that you would not be
able to get beyond the registration Scene on the program. I assure you though that all of the classes of importance have been 
commented pretty well and they would hopefully help you understand the code itself.
Go into bin/application to view the main code.
